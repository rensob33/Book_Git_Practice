    Hello world
    
    Software development life cycle begins with requirement gathering in where
    the client provides the  functional non functional requiments  to the project manager, product owner and business analyst.
    This is where the document software requirement specifications is created.
    
    
    
    
    
    The second step starts with the  Architectures and designers creating the app model based of the software designing specifications document.
    they build app model or blueprint for the app.
    
    
    
    
   In the third the developers build the software through the chosen programming langauge. this step results in a product that can be tested in the next step
    
    
    
  once developed sdets test the functional requirements  and performance testers will test  non fuctional features

 to cgeck for errors or bugs ,then inwhich they are reported to delvelopers so developers can fix the error . after the error is fixed, the software is retested and in this manner quality of the software is assured. 
 
 
  
  
  production
  app is releaased into the production envimorent  
  end users use the app and 
  
  
  
  
  mainteneance suppourt is required  for the end user and to be able to  the  need to assure any bugs or errors that may occror during new updates are added
